        I'm Igor and I am an engineer with a passion for sovling problems with
        code. For more than 10 years I've been building web applications and
        services using variety of different technologies. Ruby, Elixir,
        JavaScript, Python, you name it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still after these years I'm eager to learn and I'm always looking for
        new challenges. For the past two years I've been fully immersed into
        buiding efficient systems integrated with different AI models. On the
        other hand I've recently opened for myself the world of systems
        programming, eloquent protocols and lower level languages.

        Being blessed with a great people around me, I always try to give back
        and help the team being bigger than sum of its parts. Helping people
        grow and team to achieve goals is very rewarding and motivates me to
        wake up every day and do my best. And coffee. Coffee helps a lot ‚òïÔ∏è.
