      <p>
        I'm Igor, an engineer with a passion for solving complex problems
        through elegant code. Over the past decade, I've architected and
        developed resilient web applications and distributed services across
        multiple technology stacks including Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript, Python
        and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        My curiosity drives continuous learning and growth. Recently, I've
        focused on two complementary areas: designing efficient, scalable
        systems that leverage AI capabilities, and exploring systems programming
        with its performance-oriented languages and communication protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute beyond
        code. Mentoring colleagues, fostering team synergy, and achieving
        collective goals energizes me as much as technical challenges. This
        commitment to both technical excellence and team success guides my daily
        work‚Äîalongside plenty of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è.
