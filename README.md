# Personal Resume

This is my personal resume built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The project compiles down to a printable HTML page so that I don't have to struggle with layout and formatting in Pages or Google Docs.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run `npm run preview` to verify the production build locally.
